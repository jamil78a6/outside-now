getLatestBlock() 

{ 

return this.chain[this.chain.length - 1]; 

} 

Now that we have determined the latest block, letâ€™s see how we are going to add new blocks.

addBlock(newBlock) { 

newBlock.previousHash = this.getLatestBlock().hash; 

newBlock.hash = newBlock.calculateHash(); 

this.chain.push(newBlock); 

}
